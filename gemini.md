## PR Review Feedback Summary

*   **Do not modify shared UI components directly:** Instead of changing the default styles of components like `Button`, `Card`, and `Divider`, you should pass style objects as props to customize them for specific use cases.
*   **Use the theme for styling:** Avoid hardcoded colors; they should be sourced from the project's theme.
*   **Do not change existing localization keys:** When adding new text, create new keys in the JSON files instead of overwriting existing ones.
*   **Unrelated changes:** The addition of the `.env.example` file is not related to the feature being implemented.
*   **Performance:** There's a concern about a function in the `Card`'s styles that gets recreated on every render.
*   **Theme modification:** The reviewer questions the changes made to the `theme.ts` file.

## Maintainer Requirements

*   Do not use CSS files. All styles should be in `styles.ts` files.
*   Do not use Mantine props for styling. Use style objects instead.
*   Do not use `createStyles` from `@mantine/core` as it is deprecated in Mantine v8.
*   Use the `useMantineColorScheme` hook to get the current color scheme.
